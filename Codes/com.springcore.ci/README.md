Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of automating the building and testing of your code every time you make a change. This helps to ensure that your code is always in a working state and that any errors are caught early.

The Spring Framework is a popular Java framework for building web applications. It provides a number of features that make it easy to implement CI, such as dependency injection and inversion of control.

To implement CI in Spring, you can use a number of different tools and technologies. One popular option is to use Jenkins, a continuous integration server. Jenkins can be configured to automatically build and test your Spring application every time you make a change to the code.

Another option is to use a cloud-based CI service such as CircleCI or Travis CI. These services provide a number of features that make it easy to set up and manage a CI pipeline, such as automatic scaling and integration with popular code hosting providers.
